# Computation
## Decision Problems
We will consider only decision problems, posed as membership queries in languages. A _language_ is a set of strings, *i.e.* a subset of $\{1, 0\}*$. Thus the output will be a single bit.  

## Axioms of Computation
The _axioms of computation_ state some limitations on computational solutions to problems:

* it takes nonzero time to retrieve data from far-off locations.
* only finite information can be stored in a finite volume.
* a finite-length code has only a finite amount of control.

## Comparison of Solutions
Solutions are compared based on the resources (time or space) that they consume.
